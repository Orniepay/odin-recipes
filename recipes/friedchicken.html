    </ol>
    <h1>Ingredients: </h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>

    </ul>
    <h1>Directions: </h1>
    <strong>Step 1: </strong>
    <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>

    <br><br><br><br><br>
    <strong>Step 2: </strong>
    <p>Combine flour, paprika, salt, pepper, garlic powder,<br>
        onion powder, and cayenne in a large resealable plastic bag.<br>
        Add chicken pieces to the bag and toss to coat.</p>

    <br><br><br><br>
    <strong>Step 3: </strong>
    <p>Place floured chicken pieces on a wire rack set over<br>
        a baking sheet, reserving remaining flour in bag.<br>
        Chill chicken in the refrigerator 45 minutes or until flour looks pasty.</p>
    <br><br>
    <strong>Step 4: </strong>
    <p>Meanwhile, add 1 Â½ inches of oil to a deep fryer<br>
        or 5-quart heavy pot. Heat oil to 375 degrees F<br>
        (190 degrees C).</p>

    <br><br><br><br>
    <strong>Step 5: </strong>
    <p>Place chicken pieces back into the bag of flour<br>
        and toss once more to coat. This will help the coating<br>
        cling nicely to the chicken pieces for crispier results. <br>
        Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (93 degrees C).</p>
    <br><br>
    <strong>Step 6: </strong>
    <p>Lower chicken pieces, 2 to 3 pieces at a time,<br>
        carefully into the hot oil. Fry until golden,<br>
        turning once, about 8 to 12 minutes. An instant-read<br>
        thermometer inserted near the bone should read<br>
        165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p>

    <strong>Step 7: </strong>
    <p>Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.<br>
        Keep fried chicken warm in preheated oven while<br>
        you fry remaining chicken.</p>
