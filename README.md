# Recipes

Welcome to the **Recipes** project! This repository is dedicated to practicing and showcasing my HTML skills by building a basic recipe website.

## Project Overview

The **Recipes** website consists of a main index page that links to a variety of recipes. This project is an exercise in HTML and will be revisited in the future to incorporate CSS for styling.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to enhance my HTML knowledge and skills. It is not intended to follow a brutalist web design approach. Instead, it serves as a foundational step towards creating a fully styled and functional recipe website.

## Future Enhancements

- **CSS Styling**: The next phase of this project will involve adding CSS to improve the visual appeal and user experience.
- **Additional Recipes**: More recipes will be added to expand the content and variety.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the website is accessible and looks great on all devices.
