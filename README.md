Project: Recipes

Practicing all of my HTML knowledge I have acquired into building a basic recipe website! 

This website consists of a main index page of which will have links to a few recipes. 

The purpose of this project by no means follows a brutalist web design. 

The project is just to build my HTML chops and will be revisited in the future to be styled up with CSS.
